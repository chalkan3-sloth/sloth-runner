## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

To install `sloth-runner` on your system, you can use the provided `install.sh` script. This script automatically detects your operating system and architecture, downloads the latest release from GitHub, and places the `sloth-runner` executable in `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chalkan3/sloth-runner/master/install.sh)
```

**Note:** The `install.sh` script requires `sudo` privileges to move the executable to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Basic Usage

To run a Lua task file:

```bash
sloth-runner run -f examples/basic_pipeline.lua
```

To list tasks in a file:

```bash
sloth-runner list -f examples/basic_pipeline.lua
```

## üìú Defining Tasks in Lua

Tasks are defined in Lua files, typically within a `TaskDefinitions` table. Each task can have a `name`, `description`, `command` (either a string for shell command or a Lua function), `async` (boolean), `pre_exec` (Lua function hook), `post_exec` (Lua function hook), and `depends_on` (string or table of strings).

Example (`examples/basic_pipeline.lua`):

```lua
-- Import reusable tasks from another file. The path is relative.
local docker_tasks = import("examples/shared/docker.lua")

TaskDefinitions = {
    full_pipeline_demo = {
        description = "A comprehensive pipeline demonstrating various features.",
        tasks = {
            -- Task 1: Fetches data, runs asynchronously.
            fetch_data = {
                name = "fetch_data",
                description = "Fetches raw data from an API.",
                async = true,
                command = function(params)
                    log.info("Fetching data...")
                    -- Simulates an API call
                    return true, "echo 'Fetched raw data'", { raw_data = "api_data" }
                end,
            },

            -- Task 2: A flaky task that retries on failure.
            flaky_task = {

                command = function()
                    if math.random() > 0.5 then
                        log.info("Flaky task succeeded.")

                    end
                end,
            },

            -- Task 3: Processes data, depends on the successful completion of fetch_data and flaky_task.
            process_data = {
                name = "process_data",
                description = "Processes the fetched data.",
                depends_on = { "fetch_data", "flaky_task" },
                command = function(params, deps)
                    local raw_data = deps.fetch_data.raw_data
                    log.info("Processing data: " .. raw_data)
                    return true, "echo 'Processed data'", { processed_data = "processed_" .. raw_data }

## Advanced Features

`sloth-runner` provides several advanced features for fine-grained control over task execution.

### Task Retries and Timeouts

You can make your workflows more robust by specifying retries for flaky tasks and timeouts for long-running ones.

*   `retries`: The number of times to retry a task if it fails.
*   `timeout`: A duration string (e.g., "10s", "1m") after which a task will be terminated.

<details>
<summary>Example (`examples/retries_and_timeout.lua`):</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    robust_workflow = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate retries and timeouts",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "flaky_task",
                description = "This task fails 50% of the time",
                retries = 3,
                command = function()
                    if math.random() < 0.5 then
                        log.error("Simulating a random failure!")
                        return false, "Random failure occurred"
                    end
                    return true, "echo 'Flaky task succeeded!'", { result = "success" }
                end
            },
            {
                name = "long_running_task",
                description = "This task simulates a long process that will time out",
                timeout = "2s",
                command = "sleep 5 && echo 'This should not be printed'"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

### Conditional Execution: `run_if` and `abort_if`

You can control task execution based on conditions using `run_if` and `abort_if`. These can be either a shell command or a Lua function.

*   `run_if`: The task will only be executed if the condition is met.
*   `abort_if`: The entire execution will be aborted if the condition is met.

#### Using Shell Commands

The shell command is executed, and its exit code determines the outcome. A `0` exit code means the condition is met (success).

<details>
<summary>Example (`examples/conditional_execution.lua`):</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    conditional_workflow = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate conditional execution with run_if and abort_if.",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "check_condition_for_run",
                description = "This task creates a file that the next task checks for.",
                command = "touch /tmp/sloth_runner_run_condition"
            },
            {
                name = "conditional_task",
                description = "This task only runs if the condition file exists.",
                depends_on = "check_condition_for_run",
                run_if = "test -f /tmp/sloth_runner_run_condition",
                command = "echo 'Conditional task is running because the condition was met.'"
            },
            {
                name = "check_abort_condition",
                description = "This task will abort if a specific file exists.",
                abort_if = "test -f /tmp/sloth_runner_abort_condition",
                command = "echo 'This will not run if the abort condition is met.'"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

#### Using Lua Functions

For more complex logic, you can use a Lua function. The function receives the task's `params` and the `deps` (outputs from dependencies). It must return `true` for the condition to be met.

<details>
<summary>Example (`examples/conditional_functions.lua`):</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    conditional_functions_workflow = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate conditional execution with Lua functions.",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "setup_task",
                description = "This task provides output for the conditional task.",
                command = function()
                    return true, "Setup complete", { should_run = true }
                end
            },
            {
                name = "conditional_task_with_function",
                description = "This task only runs if the run_if function returns true.",
                depends_on = "setup_task",
                run_if = function(params, deps)
                    log.info("Checking run_if condition for conditional_task_with_function...")
                    if deps.setup_task and deps.setup_task.should_run == true then
                        log.info("Condition met, task will run.")
                        return true
                    end
                    log.info("Condition not met, task will be skipped.")
                    return false
                end,
                command = "echo 'Conditional task is running because the function returned true.'"
            },
            {
                name = "abort_task_with_function",
                description = "This task will abort the execution if the abort_if function returns true.",
                params = {
                    abort_execution = "true"
                },
                abort_if = function(params, deps)
                    log.info("Checking abort_if condition for abort_task_with_function...")
                    if params.abort_execution == "true" then
                        log.info("Abort condition met, execution will stop.")
                        return true
                    end
                    log.info("Abort condition not met.")
                    return false
                end,
                command = "echo 'This should not be executed.'"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

### Reusable Task Modules with `import`

You can create reusable libraries of tasks and import them into your main workflow file. This is useful for sharing common tasks (like building Docker images, deploying applications, etc.) across multiple projects.

The global `import()` function loads another Lua file and returns the value it returns. The path is resolved relative to the file calling `import`.

**How it works:**
1.  Create a module (e.g., `shared/docker.lua`) that defines a table of tasks and returns it.
2.  In your main file, call `import("shared/docker.lua")` to load the module.
3.  Reference the imported tasks in your main `TaskDefinitions` table using a `uses` field. `sloth-runner` will automatically merge the imported task with any local overrides you provide (like `description` or `params`).

<details>
<summary>Example Module (`examples/shared/docker.lua`):</summary>

```lua
-- examples/shared/docker.lua
-- A reusable module for Docker tasks.

local TaskDefinitions = {
    build = {
        name = "build",
        description = "Builds a Docker image",
        params = {
            tag = "latest",
            dockerfile = "Dockerfile",
            context = "."
        },
        command = function(params)
            local image_name = params.image_name or "my-default-image"
            -- ... build command logic ...
            local cmd = string.format("docker build -t %s:%s -f %s %s", image_name, params.tag, params.dockerfile, params.context)
            return true, cmd
        end
    },
    push = {
        name = "push",
        description = "Pushes a Docker image to a registry",
        -- ... push task logic ...
    }
}

return TaskDefinitions
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Example Usage (`examples/reusable_tasks.lua`):</summary>

```lua
-- examples/reusable_tasks.lua

-- Import the reusable Docker tasks.
local docker_tasks = import("shared/docker.lua")

TaskDefinitions = {
    app_deployment = {
        description = "A workflow that uses a reusable Docker module.",
        tasks = {
            -- Use the 'build' task from the module and override its params.
            build = {
                uses = docker_tasks.build,
                description = "Build the main application Docker image",
                params = {
                    image_name = "my-app",
                    tag = "v1.0.0",
                    context = "./app"
                }
            },
            
            -- A regular task that depends on the imported 'build' task.
            deploy = {
                name = "deploy",
                description = "Deploys the application",
                depends_on = "build",
                command = "echo 'Deploying...'"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

## üöÄ Advanced Features

`sloth-runner` provides several advanced features for fine-grained control over task execution.

### Next If Fail

The `next_if_fail` attribute allows you to specify a task that should only be executed if the current task fails. This is useful for cleanup or notification tasks.

<details>
<summary>Example (`examples/next_if_fail_example.lua`):</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    error_handling_workflow = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate the next_if_fail feature.",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "failing_task",
                description = "This task is designed to fail.",
                command = "exit 1"
            },
            {
                name = "cleanup_task",
                description = "This task runs only if failing_task fails.",
                next_if_fail = "failing_task",
                command = "echo 'Cleanup task executed.'"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

### Workdir Management

You can control the lifecycle of the working directory for each task group.

*   `create_workdir_before_run`: If set to `true`, a temporary directory will be created before the tasks in the group are executed. The path to this directory is available in the `params.workdir` variable in your tasks.
*   `clean_workdir_after_run`: A Lua function that determines whether the workdir should be deleted after the tasks have finished. It receives the result of the last task as an argument.

<details>
<summary>Example (`examples/workdir_lifecycle_scenarios.lua`):</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    workdir_management_demo = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate workdir management.",
        create_workdir_before_run = true,
        clean_workdir_after_run = function(last_result)
            if not last_result.success then
                log.error("Task failed. The workdir will be kept for debugging at: " .. last_result.output.workdir)
            end
            return last_result.success

### Shared Session

For tasks that need to share a common shell session (e.g., to share environment variables), you can set `execution_mode = "shared_session"` on the task group.

<summary>Example:</summary>

```lua
TaskDefinitions = {
    shared_session_demo = {
        description = "A workflow to demonstrate the shared session feature.",
        execution_mode = "shared_session",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "set_env_var",
                description = "Sets an environment variable in the shared session.",
                command = "export MY_VAR='hello from shared session'"
            },
            {
                name = "read_env_var",
                description = "Reads the environment variable from the shared session.",
                depends_on = "set_env_var",
                command = "echo $MY_VAR"
            }
        }
    }
}
