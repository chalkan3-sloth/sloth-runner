## Testing Best Practices for This Project

### 1. Use Table-Driven Tests
```go
func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {"valid input", "test", "TEST", false},
        {"empty input", "", "", true},
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := MyFunction(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("wantErr %v, got %v", tt.wantErr, err)
            }
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("expected %v, got %v", tt.expected, result)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### 2. Mock External Dependencies

For shell commands, use interfaces:
```go
type CommandExecutor interface {
    Execute(cmd string) (string, error)
}

type MockExecutor struct {
    output string
    err    error
}

func (m *MockExecutor) Execute(cmd string) (string, error) {
    return m.output, m.err
}
```

### 3. Use Temporary Directories

```go
func TestFileOperations(t *testing.T) {
    tmpDir := t.TempDir() // Auto-cleanup
    // Use tmpDir for file operations
}
```

### 4. Test Concurrency with Race Detector

```bash
go test -race ./...
```

### 5. Use Subtests for Organization

```go
func TestModule(t *testing.T) {
    t.Run("initialization", func(t *testing.T) {
        // test initialization
    })
    
    t.Run("execution", func(t *testing.T) {
        // test execution
    })
}
```

```

## Integration Test Strategy

For reaching 80% coverage efficiently, consider:

1. **Integration tests** that exercise multiple components
2. **E2E tests** for CLI commands
3. **Property-based testing** for complex logic
4. **Fuzz testing** for input validation

## Automated Testing

Consider setting up:

1. **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
   ```yaml
   - name: Run tests
     run: go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
   
   - name: Coverage threshold
     run: |
       coverage=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
       if (( $(echo "$coverage < 80" | bc -l) )); then
         echo "Coverage $coverage% is below 80%"
         exit 1
       fi
   ```

2. **Pre-commit hooks** to run tests locally

3. **Coverage badges** in README.md

## Notes

- Some modules like `internal/repl` are harder to test due to interactive nature
- The `internal/luainterface` module is very large and split across many files
- Mock external dependencies (git, kubectl, terraform, etc.) to avoid external system requirements
- Use `t.Parallel()` for tests that can run in parallel
- Some proto-generated files don't need manual tests

## Conclusion

The foundation has been laid with comprehensive tests for:
- Core data types (100% coverage)
- Core utilities and concurrency primitives (42.8% coverage)
- Agent health and metrics monitoring (69% coverage)
- Task runner basics (100% coverage)

The remaining work to reach 80% is well-defined and can be tackled incrementally following the phased approach above. Each phase builds on the previous one and targets high-impact areas first.

**Next immediate steps:**
1. Complete Phase 1 (output, stack, scaffolding) - Quick wins
2. Improve taskrunner coverage - Critical path
3. Add Lua module tests with proper mocking - Largest impact
