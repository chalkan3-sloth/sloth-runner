# SLOTH-RUNNER AGENT REMOTE EXECUTION - STATUS SUMMARY

## ✅ WORKING FUNCTIONALITY

### 1. Agent Infrastructure
- ✅ Master server running on 192.168.1.29:50053  
- ✅ Agent registration working (ladyguica: 192.168.1.16:50051, keiteguica: 192.168.1.17:50051)
- ✅ Agent name to IP resolution working
- ✅ Agent connectivity verified

### 2. Basic Remote Command Execution  
- ✅ `sloth-runner agent run ladyguica "command"` works
- ✅ Commands execute successfully on remote agents
- ⚠️ Stream handling needs improvement (shows error even on success)

### 3. Delegate_to Implementation
- ✅ delegate_to parsing implemented
- ✅ Agent name resolution working  
- ✅ Script transmission to remote agents working
- ✅ Lua script content properly sent to agents

## 🔧 CURRENT ISSUE

The delegate_to functionality sends scripts correctly to agents, but there's an execution issue on the agent side. The error "one or more task groups failed" is generic and needs more specific debugging.

## 📝 WORKING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Direct Agent Command (WORKING)
```bash
sloth-runner agent run ladyguica "hostname && date" --master 192.168.1.29:50053
sloth-runner agent run keiteguica "ls -la $HOME" --master 192.168.1.29:50053
```

### Example 2: Agent Management (WORKING)
```bash
sloth-runner agent list --master 192.168.1.29:50053
```

### Example 3: Delegate_to Syntax (IMPLEMENTED, needs debugging)
```lua
-- examples/agents/legacy_syntax_delegate.sloth
TaskDefinitions = {
    simple_remote_test = {
        description = "Simple remote test using legacy syntax",
        tasks = {
            {
                name = "test_remote",
                description = "Execute simple command on remote agent",
                command = function()
                    log.info("🚀 Executing on remote agent...")
                    local output, error, failed = exec.run("echo 'Hello from remote agent' && hostname")
                    if not failed then
                        log.info("✅ Success!")
                        log.info("📝 Output: " .. output)
                        return true, "Command executed successfully"
                    else
                        log.error("❌ Failed: " .. (error or "unknown error"))
                        return false, "Command failed"
                    end
                end,
                delegate_to = "ladyguica",
                timeout = "30s"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETION

1. **Debug agent-side execution**: The script transmission works, but execution fails
2. **Improve error messages**: Get more specific error details from agents
3. **Fix stream handling**: Remove confusing success/error messages
4. **Test Modern DSL**: Once basic delegation works, test with modern syntax

## 🔍 INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

- **Master**: ✅ Running on 192.168.1.29:50053
- **Agent ladyguica**: ✅ Connected at 192.168.1.16:50051
- **Agent keiteguica**: ✅ Connected at 192.168.1.17:50051
- **Agent Registry**: ✅ SQLite database working
- **Name Resolution**: ✅ Agent names resolve to IPs correctly

The foundation is solid and most functionality is working. The remaining issue is specific to the execution context on the agent side.
