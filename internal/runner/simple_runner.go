// Package runner provides a simplified, isolated task execution mechanism.
// It is designed to run a single task without handling the full dependency graph
// or lifecycle hooks. Its primary use is for the testing framework, allowing
// individual tasks to be executed and their outputs to be asserted. This package
// was created to break an import cycle between the 'luainterface' and 'taskrunner'
// packages.

// RunSingleTask executes a single task in a controlled, isolated Lua state.
// It is designed for testing purposes and does not handle task dependencies,
// hooks, or workdir management. It creates a new Lua state for the task,
// executes its command function, and then copies the output back to the original
// Lua state provided.
//
// Parameters:
//   L: The original Lua state, used as the destination for the output table.
//   task: The task object to be executed.
//
// Returns:
//   - bool: True if the task's command function returned true.
//   - string: The message returned by the task.
//   - *lua.LTable: The output table from the task, copied to the original state L.
//   - time.Duration: The total execution time of the task.
//   - error: Any error that occurred during the execution of the Lua function.
