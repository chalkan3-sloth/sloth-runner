- 📊 Identify risk patterns
- ⚠️ Alert before issues occur
- 🔄 Suggest preventive actions

## Features

### Pattern Recognition
Analyzes historical failures to identify common patterns.

### Early Warning System
Alerts you when conditions match failure patterns.

### Automated Recovery
Suggests or implements automatic recovery strategies.

## Configuration

```lua
workflow.define("safe_workflow", {
    failure_prediction = {
        enabled = true,
        confidence_threshold = 0.75,
        auto_prevent = true
    },
    tasks = { ... }
})
