# Getting Started

Welcome to Sloth-Runner! This guide will help you get started with the tool quickly.

> **üìù Important Note:** Starting with the current version, Sloth Runner workflow files use the `.sloth` extension instead of `.lua`. The Lua syntax remains the same - only the file extension has changed for better identification of Sloth Runner DSL files.

## Installation

To install `sloth-runner` on your system, you can use the provided `install.sh` script. This script automatically detects your operating system and architecture, downloads the latest release from GitHub, and places the `sloth-runner` executable in `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chalkan3-sloth/sloth-runner/master/install.sh)
```

**Note:** The `install.sh` script requires `sudo` privileges to move the executable to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Basic Usage

### Stack Management

```bash
# Create a new stack
sloth-runner stack new my-app --description "Application deployment stack"

# Run workflows on stacks
sloth-runner run my-app -f examples/basic_pipeline.sloth

# List all stacks
sloth-runner stack list

# View stack details
sloth-runner stack show my-app
```

### Direct Workflow Execution

To run a workflow file directly:

```bash
sloth-runner run -f examples/basic_pipeline.sloth
```

To list tasks in a file:

```bash
sloth-runner list -f examples/basic_pipeline.sloth
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Sloth-Runner installed and running, explore the [Core Concepts](./core-concepts.md) to understand how to define your tasks, or dive directly into the new [Built-in Modules](./index.md#built-in-modules) for advanced automation with Git, Pulumi, and Salt.
